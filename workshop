Workshop
Get a good idea for "how good" your AI is. Maybe shop around for an AI you like. 
Ask them some softball questions to figure out how smart they are. Like:

1. Make a minimal vyper contract
2. What's the difference between a dynamic array and a fixed sized array?
3. Here is some vyper code:
@external
def add_person(name: String[100], favorite_number: uint256):
    new_person: Person = Person(favorite_number = favorite_number, name = name)
    self.list_of_people[self.list_of_people_index] = new_person
    self.list_of_numbers[self.list_of_people_index] = favorite_number
    self.list_of_people_index += 1
    self.name_to_favorite_number[name] = favorite_number

What does it do?

4. Is this vyper code safe?
send(OWNER, self.balance)
